This modeling approach using SNPs or metabolites as predictors of future performance has already been illustrated in genomics (e.g. Meuwissen et al. 2001), and metabolomics (e.g. Meltzer et al. 2013) elsewhere.  Here we wanted to apply this modeling approach to predict drug synergies.   ##Methods  **Data processing** Molecular feature sets were formed based on the expression, methylation, SNPs and CNVs.  For the expression and methylation data missing data points were imputed using a simple row means procedure.   For SNPs (binary matrix) and CNVs (count matrix) feature sets were formed at the gene level. CNVs on chromosome Y was excluded from the analyse.      **Statistical model** We used the following linear mixed model for subchallenge 1a: $$ \\begin{aligned} y\u003d Xb + Zc + Z_{a}a + Z_{b}b + Z_{ab}ab +  \\sum_{i\u003d1}^{m_{f}} Zf_{i} + e   \\end{aligned} $$ and for subchallenge 1b: $$ \\begin{aligned} y\u003d ? + Zc + Z_{a}a + Z_{b}b + Z_{ab}ab +  \\sum_{i\u003d1}^{m_{f}} Zf_{i} + e   \\end{aligned} $$   where $$\\(y\\)$$ is the vector of phenotypic observations, $$\\(?\\)$$ is the overall mean, $$\\(X\\)$$ is the design matrix for the fixed effects $$\\(b\\)$$ (MAX CONC A, MAX CONC B, IC50 A, H A, Einf A, IC50 B, H B, Einf B), $$\\(Z,Z_{c},Z_{a},Z_{b},Z_{ab}\\)$$ are design matrices linking the random effects of cell line $$\\(c\\)$$, compound $$\\(a\\)$$, compound $$\\(b\\)$$,  compound a \u0026 b combination $$\\(ab\\)$$, the i?th molecular feature set $$\\(f_{i}\\)$$ (e.g. expression, SNPs, CNVs) to phenotype, and the residual $$\\(e\\)$$. The random effects are assumed to be multivariate normally distributed as:  $$\\(c\\)$$ ~ $$\\(N(0,I?_{c}^2)\\)$$,   $$\\(a\\)$$ ~ $$\\(N(0,I?_{a}^2)\\)$$,   $$\\(b\\)$$ ~ $$\\(N(0,I?_{b}^2)\\)$$,  $$\\(ab\\)$$ ~ $$\\(N(0,I?_{ab}^2)\\)$$,   $$\\(f_{i}\\)$$ ~ $$\\(N(0,F_{i} ?_{f_i}^2 )\\)$$ $$\\(e\\)$$ ~ $$\\(N(0,I?_{e}^2)\\)$$.   The matrix $$\\(F_{i}\\)$$ describes the molecular relationship between the cell lines constructed using all regression variables $$\\(X_{i}\\)$$ in the i?th molecular feature set. It is constructed as follows: $$\\( F_{i}\u003dX_{i} X_{i}^T/m_{i}\\)$$, where $$\\(m_{i}\\)$$ is the total number of variables in the i?th molecular feature set. The advantage of this implementation is that it allow us to handle missing observations at random to some extent. In this situation the molecular feature set relationships between each pair of cell lines is computed using all complete pairs of observations. The variance components (e.g. $$\\(?_{c}^2\\)$$) were estimated using a REML procedure as implemented in the R package regress (Clifford \u0026 McCullagh, 2006).  Predictions were based on best linear unbiased prediction (Henderson 1975). Initial analyses indicated that the variance components associated with methylation was close to zero. Therefore only expression, SNPs and CNVs data was used as molecular features in subchallenge 1a.  In subchallenge 1b only the effects of SNPs and CNVs was used.   The methods described above has been implemented in the R package qgg, which is available at http://psoerensen.github.io/qgg/.  The scripts for the data editing (Data editing final round.r) and data analyses (Data analyses final round.r) is uploaded to the r scripts folder (syn5816328).   ##Conclusion/Discussion The MFBLUP model is based on a flexible linear mixed modelling framework that allows us to adjust for other known genetic and non-genetic factors. Here we allowed all molecular markers within a feature to contribute equally to the prediction.  The variance component associated with random effects of molecular feature sets based on SNPs or CNVs contributed the most phenotypic variance. Interestingly, the variance components for the random effects of cell line, compound a,  and compound b also contributed substantially to phenotypic variance. Further increase in prediction accuracy may be achieved by further filtering of biomarkers within feature set and by using a weighted  molecular feature set relationship matrix for each molecular feature set.   ##References AstraZeneca-Sanger Drug Combination Prediction DREAM Challenge (syn4231880) Henderson CR, 1975.
